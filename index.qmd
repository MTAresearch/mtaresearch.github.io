MTA Research helps retailers and solution providers turn complex data and operational knowledge into practical loss-prevention strategies. We apply crime-science methods and rigorous evaluation to deliver results you can implement—without the jargon.

## What we do

- **Retail crime research & analytics**  
  Analyse incidents, products, people and places; diagnose drivers of loss; produce clear, decision-ready insights.

- **Fraud & abuse prevention**  
  Map problem behaviours using crime scripting; identify weak points; design opportunity-reduction controls that work in real operations.

- **Program design & evaluation**  
  Build measurement frameworks through to quasi-experimental evaluation; track uplift, ROI and operational impact.

- **Workshops & training**  
  Short, practical sessions on crime-science tools and prevention scripting; co-design workshops with store and central teams.

## Why MTA Research

### Applied academic rigour
MTA Research is led by Michael Townsley (PhD), a criminologist with two decades in crime science and retail loss prevention. Our work draws on peer-reviewed research, transparent methods, and a practical orientation to implementation.

### Retail-first, results-focused
We have experience supporting major retailers and industry bodies across Australia and New Zealand. We focus on outputs that are executive-ready and operationally useful.

### Data governance & confidentiality
We treat confidentiality as a default. We work under NDAs where required and use privacy-aware approaches to business data and survey measurement.

## Start a conversation
If you have a problem to diagnose, a program to evaluate, or a prevention strategy to sharpen, we’re happy to discuss fit and scope.
