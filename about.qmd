## Our focus

We work at the intersection of:

- **Retail crime and loss** (incidents, people, products, places, processes)
- **Fraud and abuse** (behaviour mapping, opportunity reduction, controls and measurement)
- **Evaluation** (credible designs that fit real-world rollouts and constraints)

## Our approach

We prioritise:

- **Decision-first research** — start from the decision you need to make, then design methods to support it
- **Rigour without theatre** — clear assumptions, transparent limits, results that stand up to scrutiny
- **Implementation realism** — recommendations that can be delivered in operational settings
- **Clarity** — plain language, concise reporting, and well-structured outputs


## Independence

MTA Research is an independent consultancy and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any university or institution.
