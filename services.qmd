MTA Research provides independent, evidence-led support across prevention strategy, analytics, and evaluation. Engagements are tailored to your decision context, data environment, and operational constraints.

## 1) Retail crime research & analytics

**What we do**  
We help make sense of incident, people, product and location data to identify what is driving loss and what is most likely to reduce it.

**Typical questions**

- Where is loss concentrated, and what patterns are emerging over time?
- What distinguishes routine error from fraud/abuse signals?
- Which stores, products, or processes should be prioritised for prevention effort?

**Common outputs**

- Analytical report (plain-language findings, clear visuals, defensible methods)
- Executive brief with prioritised recommendations
- Dashboards/figures suitable for operational and executive audiences

## 2) Fraud & abuse prevention

**What we do**  
We use crime scripting and opportunity-reduction thinking to map how abuse occurs and where controls can be applied with minimal friction.

**Typical questions**

- How is policy being exploited, and at which steps does it become preventable?
- Which controls are likely to reduce opportunity without harming legitimate customers?
- What indicators can be monitored to detect emerging abuse types?

**Common outputs**

- Behaviour typology and risk indicators (plain language, operationally interpretable)
- Prevention script / control map with options and trade-offs
- Measurement approach to track change after implementation

## 3) Program design & evaluation

**What we do**  
We design measurement frameworks and evaluation plans that match the realities of rollout, compliance, and operational variation.

**Typical questions**

- Is the program working, for whom, and under what conditions?
- What is the best feasible design for credible measurement (given constraints)?
- What is the likely uplift/ROI, and what assumptions drive it?

**Common outputs**

- Evaluation plan (questions, measures, sampling, timeline)
- Pre/post survey instruments and analysis plan (where appropriate)
- Results reporting that supports decision-making, not just description

## 4) Workshops & training

**What we do**  
We run practical sessions that help teams apply crime-science tools to their own context and produce usable outputs.

**Formats**

- Short skills sessions (90–180 minutes) on core tools and interpretation
- Co-design workshops to generate prevention actions and prioritise controls
- Facilitation for cross-team alignment on definitions, measures and next steps

**Common outputs**

- Workshop pack (templates, examples, facilitation materials)
- Summary of outputs and prioritised action list
- Follow-on recommendations for implementation and measurement

## Not sure which service fits?
We can usually clarify fit quickly from a short description of the problem, the decision you need to make, and what data (if any) is available.
